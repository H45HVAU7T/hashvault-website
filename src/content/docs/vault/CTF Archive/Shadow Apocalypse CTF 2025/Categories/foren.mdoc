## 🔹 Challenge 3: Behind the Verveine  
**Points:** 400  
**Description:** 
```
The Sentinels slipped through — but their ride didn’t.

Our team cracked open the vehicle they left behind. Hidden deep in the car's onboard system, past wiped logs and ghost drives, we recovered one thing a suspicious-looking disk.img file. No name. No metadata. Just static… or so it seems. "Neither the pigeons nor the Ravens were used, then what shall it be in this digital world?"

Intel says someone, somewhere, already managed to scrape out part of the secret — they claim the "flag" was found in an unknown baseXX encoding. But that’s it. No format, no key, no confirmation.

Your mission Crack this. Find what’s buried inside that file. Use the one lead you’ve got — that this thing’s cloaked in some form of base encoding, something dirtier. You’ll have to test, dig, and peel until the real message bleeds out.

Shadow Nexus leaves no trace… but this time, they left a digital scar. Find it. Decode it. And expose their next layer.
