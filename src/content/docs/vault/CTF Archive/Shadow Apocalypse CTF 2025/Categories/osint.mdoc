## üîπ Challenge 1: cam_verd-4325
**Points:** 150  
**Description:** 
```
They don‚Äôt exist on paper.

They don‚Äôt speak names.

They vanish before you even know they were there.

They are the Shadow Nexus ‚Äî a covert syndicate operating beneath firewalls, between borders, and beyond fingerprints. Governments deny them. Satellites can‚Äôt see them. But every collapsed deal, every burned archive, every vanishing trace‚Ä¶ points to them.

Now, for the first time, there‚Äôs a breach.

One image. One mistake.

The game begins.

The Shadow Nexus moves like a phantom ‚Äî silent, invisible, untouchable. This rare image is the only footage when they entered the terminal. Your mission: flip the scene, reveal their true colours. But that‚Äôs just the beginning. The gang was busted ‚Äî or so they thought. Turns out, those caught were decoys. The real Sentinels escaped, leaving behind only one lead: their getaway wheels. But the vehicle? Erased from public records by the government, buried to keep things quiet. Your task: dig through the digital underworld, find the forgotten ride, and expose the truth.

## üîπ Challenge 2: Chocolate Rust
**Points:** 250  
**Description:** 
```
That crew of masterminds who vanish before anyone blinks. They‚Äôre always on the run, untouchable ‚Äî until now. One of their elite Sentinels was caught on a grainy camera slipping into a cozy Chocolate bar. A high-rolling gangster in a place known for hot cocoa and truffles? That‚Äôs no coincidence ‚Äî it‚Äôs a clue.

Your mission: hunt down the vehicle name the Sentinel ditched near the chocolate bar. The picture is the only lead. Word is, that ride ‚Äî maybe a sleek coupe, maybe a beat-up truck, can be anything‚Äî holds a digital disk packed with secrets that could crack the Nexus wide open. The vehicle's name and records? Wiped clean, buried deep by the Nexus or someone covering their tracks.

## üîπ Challenge 5: Whisper behind Velvets  
**Points:** 600  
**Description:** 
```
While one Sentinel made his move at the chocolate bar, his partner wasn‚Äôt far behind ‚Äî but his trail is even dirtier. He slipped into a neon-lit lounge, a lounge known for its velvet seats and private rooms. In a private backroom, away from prying eyes, he was seen whispering with a contact about a wall painting.

Not just any painting‚Ä¶ a scene of the some kind of ancient theater, the intel guess? its foundation lies in the ashes of 70 CE, when treasures crossed from the East to build spectacles for the West. A coded drop? A location hint? All signs point to it.

Your mission: Track the whispers. Dig through the reports, find the exact coordinates they were hinting at. The coordinates tied to that unknown painting is your next key.

The Nexus leaves no trails ‚Äî but tonight, their tongues slipped. Find the spot. Mark the coordinates. Crack this, and you peel another layer off the Shadow Nexus.
```
  
**Flag Format:** `flag{00.0000000,00.0000000}`
